# Sentimental-Analysis

Sentimental analysis   could possibly help in finding the exact context of the sentences and so on.  Sentimental analysis  is  deployed in  various  field  and  have  wide  applications  in  the  field  of   machine  learning  and  natural  language   processing  .   Sentimental  analysis   can  also  help   in  accessing  the  no   of   reviews  in  favour   and  against      the  organization .   Sentimental   analysis     helps   in the growth   of organization.   Sentimental  analysis  seems  conventionally    following    based  on   Naïve  Bayes  Classifier  but the  model  is  too  model  and  has  several  flaws  .  This  paper  aims  to  suggest  the  improvements  by   introducing    Polarity  calculation  algorithm  which  is  previously   introduced  in one  of  the  research  but  the polarity  algorithm   fails  on  the  non – typo  words and  non-dictionary  words  and  so  on.   Our aims  is  to   combine the  duo   by  introducing  an  interim solution  which  seems  Naive Bayes  Classifier   in  this   case  which  could  help  in  further  enhancing  and improving  possibly  increasing  68% to 70%
